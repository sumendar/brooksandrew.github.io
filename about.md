I'm a Data Scientist at a small data mining consulting company in DC called [Elder Research](http://datamininglab.com/).  I turn data into numbers, numbers into words, 
words into stories and stories into action for my clients.

I started my professional career on the Economics PhD track at the Federal Reserve Board.  I took some abstract math classes to prepare, but then I started 
taking some cool applied statistics courses at Georgetown U.  I started getting good (and interested) in programming and less interested in abstract
academic research.  I decided to leave the Fed to finish my Mathematics & Statistics Master's program at Georgetown U and work as a Data Scientist at Elder Research, a 
small consulting firm specializing in data mining and predictive analytics.  I love starting projects from scratch: working with clients to identify their problems, strategizing 
analytic approaches, creating models using machine learning methods and operationalizing these models to truly drive behavior and improve decision making.

### My career path has gone something like this:

>I started undergrad doing international relations thinking big picture with ambitions to be a diplomat of sorts.  
Then I got hooked on economics.  
Then I realized economics is really math.  
Then I realized I was better at computer languages than abstract mathematical languages and foreign languages.  
Then I realized I actually liked computer languages; that I could actually be more creative and powerful with data and code.    
Then I got a job where I get to learn as much about data science and machine learning as possible.  
Then I realized building models for people is harder than just building models for people.  
Then I started turning numbers into words, words into stories and stories into action.  
Then I started building this website.
